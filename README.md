# cfr-xml-parsing
Scripts to parse XML files representing the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs).

The goal of this project is to be able to extract regulatory information into a form that can more easily be used in other applications.  By extracting the various chapters, parts, subparts, and sections individually it is easy to get the data into a new format.

The entire Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) can be downloaded in XML through the Government Printing Office using the following link: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/CFR

The user guide and XML schema can be found in the resources subdirectory: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/CFR/resources

Also check out http://www.ecfr.gov for web access for the CFR.
